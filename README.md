Allows the player to set their name, ex: /setname John Doe

It then uses the set name in /me's and /gme's.

Also allows tagging, ex: /do You find 3 open containers and a loaded pistol in the passenger footwell. @John Doe

The person with their name set as John Doe will see "@John Doe" highlighted, whilst people who are not named that, will just see it as plain white. pretty neat
